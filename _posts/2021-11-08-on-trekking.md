I did my first real trek (abeit a very short one) on 31st December 2016, and since then, I have been wanting to put into words to how I feel about it. I got into trekking around the same time that I was getting into long distance running and meditation, and my feelings about all three are mingled in some ways. Today though, I want to talk about just trekking - the multi-day, high-altitude, camping-out, no-signal-for-days kind.

This post has two parts to it - first, my thoughts on trekking, and second, a brief glimpse of the sport for someone who is considering his first trek. 

## What I talk about when I talk about trekking

My first trek was a lucky accident - on a trip to Sikkim, I had to overhaul my itinerary and ended up at a village called Yakten, in East Sikkim. Yakten had a small hour long trek called Jhandi Dara that could be done at 5AM to watch the sun rising on Kanchenjunga. I reached the view point in pitch dark, and saw the first sunrays forming a red circle on the east face of the mountain; slowly consuming the other peaks as it grew brighter and changed colors over time. Below is a shot I took on my phone a couple minutes after sunrise:

The view was nothing too special in retrospect, but as a 21yo who had lived in the North Indian plains all his life, I was hooked! I decided I will chase more of whatever this magic was.

In the almost 5 years since then, I’ve done lots of short treks, and three major high altitude treks - Roopkund, Rupin Pass, and Kuari Pass. I’ve trekked at times purely as a sport or for the sheer joy of it, and at others almost as a pilgrim in a spiritual crisis. If someone were to ask me today why I trek, I would say I trek because:

### It is incredibly healing

> *A day comes when, thanks to rigidity, nothing causes wonder any more, everything is known, and life is spent in beginning over again….To come alive again one needs a special grace, self-forgetfulness, or a homeland. Certain mornings, on turning a corner, a delightful dew falls on the heart and then evaporates. But its coolness remains and this is what the heart requires always.*
>
> Albert Camus, Return To Tipasa

I came back from Kuari Pass just a week ago, after a whole year of burnout, isolation, and physical, emotional and spiritual exhaustion. [There’s something about forests and mountains](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_nature_helps_us_heal), and the sheer scale of effort during a trek, that has the capacity to melt long frozen corners of our hearts. One of the first things I noticed after coming back was that after a very long time, I felt a bit more human again, complete with feelings of hope, excitement and gratefulness, and a bit less like the numb planning and problem solving machine I had become. I remember sitting with my lunch at a rest point, thinking gleefully about how free I had felt during the last 4 days - no move to plan, no instructions to follow, no lists to make, no calendars to fill - and suddenly wondering what the hell had been making me so miserable all year.

### It’s a stark break from the usual hum of life

You could argue all travel is like that, and that’s the reason anyone travels at all, and I would partly agree. But treks break up any sort of structure in your life so thoroughly that you are left with nothing to hide behind. You can’t read news, check your mail, grab a smoke, binge on Netflix, scroll through Instagram, switch on the hotel TV, or consume whatever your numbing drug of choice is (DON’T BRING BOOKS ON TREKS).

Everytime I have come back from a long trek, I have in some way re-examined the way I had been living and made some changes to it, because when you come back from a trek, you view your own life with a fresh set of eyes and a clearer head, ready to drop unecessary baggage accumulated along the way, and packing lightly for the journey ahead.

### It can be as communal or as solitary a journey as you want to make it
